=head1 NAME

SSL_CTX_share_session_cache - enable sharing of session cache

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 #include <openssl/ssl.h>

 int SSL_CTX_share_session_cache(SSL_CTX *a, SSL_CTX *b);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

SSL_CTX_share_session_cache() function releases the session list of B<b> and
then sets the session list to be the same as B<a>. Both SSL_CTX objects
then share and modify the same session list.

=head1 NOTES

The sessions lists are stored in their own reference-counted object. When
an SSL_CTX is created, it has its own session list. This function releases
the session list of the second argument SSL_CTX B<b> and has B<b> reference
the session list of SSL_CTX B<a>.

In the following example:

 SSL_CTX_share_session_cache(b, c);
 SSL_CTX_share_session_cache(a, b);

The result of this is that B<c>'s initial session list is freed, and references
B<b>'s initial session list. B<b> and B<a> both reference B<a>'s initial
session list.

There is no way to undo this; a new SSL_CTX should be created instead.

=head1 RETURN VALUES

This function returns 1 on success and 0 on failure.
